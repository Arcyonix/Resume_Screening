# Resume Screening Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Screening resumes during the hiring process has always been a challenge for the human resource department, whether it is done manually or with existing tools that filter out candidates. The question now arises: how can machine learning tools be effectively incorporated to identify the ideal employee for any job, based on job descriptions and provided resumes?

This project is based on a HackerEarth challenge focused on hiring a perfect machine learning engineer. Various machine learning models such as XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest are employed and compared to determine the most effective learner in this context. Furthermore, deep learning models like BERT are also used. The results will show which model is the best to use in this context.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from resumes and job descriptions.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - XGBoost (XGB)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Implementation of a deep learning model:
  - BERT
- Comparative analysis of the models to determine the most effective one for resume screening.
